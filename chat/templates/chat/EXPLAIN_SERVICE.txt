Everybase helps you find sellers and buyers.

We charge a small connection fee.

When you select the option to connect with a seller/buyer we referred to you, you'd be sent a payment link.

On making payment, you'd receive the contact for the seller/buyer.

*You will NOT be matched with the same buyer/seller twice.*
