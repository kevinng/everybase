We worked with the US authorized distributor, a direct distributor of AstraZeneca (AZ).  \n\nHere it is the process:\n\n1.\tDue to sensitivity, AstraZeneca (AZ) is very selective where they can buy to private sectors. Therefore, the first step to issue LOI and Letter of Authorization from the Government that they are allowed to buy, and the proof of funds.\n\n2.\tOnce the buyer is complied with the requirement and due diligence, and due to a shortage of available vaccines (it runs out quickly) therefore, the buyer should issue a PO (non-binding). To issue the PO is ensure you can reserve the vaccines as it is usually sold-out within hours. We have been given by AZ to hold allocation per week.\n\n3.\tThen it will be followed by a video call where we will be discussing the SPA.\n\n4.\tThere is currently 20M lot of AZ vaccines ready Stock in London but the price is US$49 per dose + a Maximum of 12% (Profit + Commission) and it is also FOB. The airport is Heathrow. This Lot you can ship out tomorrow.\n\n5.\tThe price of AZ vaccines is varied day by day. Maximum 12% (Profit + Commission) - 1 vial there are 10 doses -1 big box their Minimum order is 2 million. Time delivery is 2 to 4 weeks delivery shipment.\n\n6.\tPayment 50% deposit and balance 50% to be paid upon shipment. Payment through escrow account which is directly to AZ.  The rest commission to be paid through this escrow account and the commission will go directly to you.\n\n7.\tRemember the buyer should get a letter of authorization from the Government. This can obtain through the Ministry of Health or through the food and drug administration of the country.\n\nTo ensure security, there will be a video call together with the distributor and AstraZeneca people directly too.\n\nPlease share with the buyer and do let us know if they are ready.\n\nThank you!"
